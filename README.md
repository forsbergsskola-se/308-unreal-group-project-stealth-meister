The Art of Thievery: A Silent Heist by The Stealthmeisters

Who are the Stealthmeisters? We are 4 talented game programming students attending the Game Programming course at Forsbergs Skola in Stockholm, Sweden. Hildur-Hanna LÃ¶nn-Holmqvist, Jacob Roming, Sofie Persson, Stewart Wan  

The brief for this project was to create the prototype for a game of our choice that is engaging and enjoyable, at the same time with appropriate audio / video assets to compliment the theme and enhance the overall player experience. The choice of game was at our discretion so long as it met the requirements of the project.  
Duration: 4 weeks  
Tech: Unreal Engine 5.2, Blueprints, Atlassian Confluence, Atlassian Jira Software, Fork Git Client, Github Desktop, GitHub

We decided on a stealth action game in the tradition of grand heist movie, stealing valuable objects from secure places around the globe. Using stealth, the players objective is to enter places unseen, evade the various security systems in place to protect the objective, to steal it and to get away without being detected. Thus The Art of Thievery: A Silent Heist was conceived.

We used Unreal Engine 5.2 and the Blueprint visual scripting system to quickly create the core mechanics of the game, from the UI to the Audio assets implemented ingame.
